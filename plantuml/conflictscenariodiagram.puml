title Traffic Light Conflict Scenario

object "Intersection" as intersection {
  State: INTERSECTION
}

object "Light NS" as ns_light {
  Direction: NORTH-SOUTH
  Cycle: 10s
  State: GREEN
}

object "Light EW" as ew_light {
  Direction: EAST-WEST
  Cycle: 10s
  State: GREEN
}

object "Car 1" as car1 {
  Direction: NORTH
  Position: Before intersection
}

object "Car 2" as car2 {
  Direction: EAST
  Position: Before intersection
}

ns_light --> intersection : Controls
ew_light --> intersection : Controls
car1 --> intersection : Moving to
car2 --> intersection : Moving to

note right 
  Conflict occurs when:
  - Lights are perpendicular
  - Cycles are multiples
  - Both green simultaneously
  => Potential collision
end note
